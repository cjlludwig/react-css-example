  React CSS Example
</h1>

Styling in web development is often one of the most temperamental forms of programming, which causes many devs to avoid the front end like the plague. Working with React helped to move web development towards a more standardized syntax that enabled users to jump between server-side and front end Js with ease but styling still proves to be a Wild West of methodology. My aim with this repository is to offer several examples of "clean" styling methods along with some of my personal thoughts on the pros and cons of each.

This repo is a work in progress. Several of the styling and pages are not finished at the moment.
